# NextAvailableRead
Work in progress. No functionality at the moment.

### SETUP

After downloading NextAvailableRead.py, save a text file in the same folder named ".env" (without the quotation marks).
In this file, add:

API_KEY = <Your API code here>

API_SECRET = <Your API secret code here>

replacing the parts to the right of "API_KEY" and "API_SECRET" with your keys, that can be obtained from
https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys. You will need a Goodreads account.

Next, run NextAvailableRead.py. The program will give you instructions for authentication and is self-explanatory from there.
