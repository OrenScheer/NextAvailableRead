# NextAvailableRead
A web app that bridges the gap between Goodreads and the Ottawa Public Library, finding books on a user's "to-read" shelf on Goodreads that are currently available in e-book format at the Ottawa Public Library.

Work in progress: My Goodreads user id is currently hard-coded in, and the interface needs improvement.

A user's Goodreads shelves must be public.

### SETUP

After cloning the repository, run `set FLASK_APP=instance.py` on Windows, replacing `set` with `export` on other operating systems. Follow this with `flask run`, and open the specified server in a browser of your choice.
